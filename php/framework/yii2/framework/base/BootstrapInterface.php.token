This is done by configuring the [[Application::bootstrap]] property:\n *\n * ```php\n * return [\n *     \/\/ ...\n *     'bootstrap' => [\n *         \"path\\\\to\\\\MyBootstrapClass1\",\n *         [\n *             'class' => \"path\\\\to\\\\MyBootstrapClass2\",\n *             'prop1' => 'value1',\n *             'prop2' => 'value2',\n *         ],\n *     ],\n * ];\n * ```\n *\n * As you can see, you can register a bootstrapping class in terms of either a class name or a configuration class.\n *\n * For more details and usage information on BootstrapInterface, see the [guide article on bootstrapping applications](guide:structure-applications).\n *\n * @author Qiang Xue <qiang.xue@gmail.com>\n * @since 2.0\n *\/",10],["T_WHITESPACE","\n",54],["T_INTERFACE","interface",55],["T_WHITESPACE"," ",55],["T_STRING","BootstrapInterface",55],["T_WHITESPACE","\n",55],"{",["T_WHITESPACE","\n    ",56],["T_DOC_COMMENT","\/**\n     * Bootstrap method to be called during application bootstrap stage.\n     * @param Application $app the application currently running\n     *\/",57],["T_WHITESPACE","\n    ",60],["T_PUBLIC","public",61],["T_WHITESPACE"," ",61],["T_FUNCTION","function",61],["T_WHITESPACE"," ",61],["T_STRING","bootstrap",61],"(",["T_VARIABLE","$app",61],")",";",["T_WHITESPACE","\n",61],"}",["T_WHITESPACE","\n",62]]
