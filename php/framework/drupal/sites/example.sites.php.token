These aliases are loaded prior to\n * scanning for directories, and they are exempt from the normal discovery\n * rules. See default.settings.php to view how Drupal discovers the\n * configuration directory when no alias is found.\n *\n * Aliases are useful on development servers, where the domain name may not be\n * the same as the domain of the live server. Since Drupal stores file paths in\n * the database (files, system table, etc.) this will ensure the paths are\n * correct when the site is deployed to a live server.\n *\n * To activate this feature, copy and rename it such that its path plus\n * filename is 'sites\/sites.php'.\n *\n * Aliases are defined in an associative array named $sites. The array is\n * written in the format: '<port>.<domain>.<path>' => 'directory'. As an\n * example, to map https:\/\/www.drupal.org:8080\/mysite\/test to the configuration\n * directory sites\/example.com, the array should be defined as:\n * @code\n * $sites = array(\n *   '8080.www.drupal.org.mysite.test' => 'example.com',\n * );\n * @endcode\n * The URL, https:\/\/www.drupal.org:8080\/mysite\/test\/, could be a symbolic link\n * or an Apache Alias directive that points to the Drupal root containing\n * index.php. An alias could also be created for a subdomain. See the\n * @link https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/documentation\/install online Drupal installation guide @endlink\n * for more information on setting up domains, subdomains, and subdirectories.\n *\n * The following examples look for a site configuration in sites\/example.com:\n * @code\n * URL: http:\/\/dev.drupal.org\n * $sites['dev.drupal.org'] = 'example.com';\n *\n * URL: http:\/\/localhost\/example\n * $sites['localhost.example'] = 'example.com';\n *\n * URL: http:\/\/localhost:8080\/example\n * $sites['8080.localhost.example'] = 'example.com';\n *\n * URL: https:\/\/www.drupal.org:8080\/mysite\/test\/\n * $sites['8080.www.drupal.org.mysite.test'] = 'example.com';\n * @endcode\n *\n * @see default.settings.php\n * @see \\Drupal\\Core\\DrupalKernel::getSitePath()\n * @see https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/documentation\/install\/multi-site\n *\/",3],["T_WHITESPACE","\n",55]]
