Refer to the sample in the section above as a\n * starting point.\n *\n * The \"driver\" property indicates what Drupal database driver the\n * connection should use.  This is usually the same as the name of the\n * database type, such as mysql or sqlite, but not always.  The other\n * properties will vary depending on the driver.  For SQLite, you must\n * specify a database file name in a directory that is writable by the\n * webserver.  For most other drivers, you must specify a\n * username, password, host, and database name.\n *\n * Transaction support is enabled by default for all drivers that support it,\n * including MySQL. To explicitly disable it, set the 'transactions' key to\n * FALSE.\n * Note that some configurations of MySQL, such as the MyISAM engine, don't\n * support it and will proceed silently even if enabled. If you experience\n * transaction related crashes with such configuration, set the 'transactions'\n * key to FALSE.\n *\n * For each database, you may optionally specify multiple \"target\" databases.\n * A target database allows Drupal to try to send certain queries to a\n * different database if it can but fall back to the default connection if not.\n * That is useful for primary\/replica replication, as Drupal may try to connect\n * to a replica server when appropriate and if one is not available will simply\n * fall back to the single primary server (The terms primary\/replica are\n * traditionally referred to as master\/slave in database server documentation).\n *\n * The general format for the $databases array is as follows:\n * @code\n * $databases['default']['default'] = $info_array;\n * $databases['default']['replica'][] = $info_array;\n * $databases['default']['replica'][] = $info_array;\n * $databases['extra']['default'] = $info_array;\n * @endcode\n *\n * In the above example, $info_array is an array of settings described above.\n * The first line sets a \"default\" database that has one primary database\n * (the second level default).  The second and third lines create an array\n * of potential replica databases.  Drupal will select one at random for a given\n * request as needed.  The fourth line creates a new database with a name of\n * \"extra\".\n *\n * You can optionally set prefixes for some or all database table names\n * by using the 'prefix' setting. If a prefix is specified, the table\n * name will be prepended with its value. Be sure to use valid database\n * characters only, usually alphanumeric and underscore. If no prefixes\n * are desired, leave it as an empty string ''.\n *\n * To have all database names prefixed, set 'prefix' as a string:\n * @code\n *   'prefix' => 'main_',\n * @endcode\n * To provide prefixes for specific tables, set 'prefix' as an array.\n * The array's keys are the table names and the values are the prefixes.\n * The 'default' element is mandatory and holds the prefix for any tables\n * not specified elsewhere in the array. Example:\n * @code\n *   'prefix' => array(\n *     'default'   => 'main_',\n *     'users'     => 'shared_',\n *     'sessions'  => 'shared_',\n *     'role'      => 'shared_',\n *     'authmap'   => 'shared_',\n *   ),\n * @endcode\n * You can also use a reference to a schema\/database as a prefix. This may be\n * useful if your Drupal installation exists in a schema that is not the default\n * or you want to access several databases from the same code base at the same\n * time.\n * Example:\n * @code\n *   'prefix' => array(\n *     'default'   => 'main.',\n *     'users'     => 'shared.',\n *     'sessions'  => 'shared.',\n *     'role'      => 'shared.',\n *     'authmap'   => 'shared.',\n *   );\n * @endcode\n * NOTE: MySQL and SQLite's definition of a schema is a database.\n *\n * Advanced users can add or override initial commands to execute when\n * connecting to the database server, as well as PDO connection settings. For\n * example, to enable MySQL SELECT queries to exceed the max_join_size system\n * variable, and to reduce the database connection timeout to 5 seconds:\n * @code\n * $databases['default']['default'] = array(\n *   'init_commands' => array(\n *     'big_selects' => 'SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1',\n *   ),\n *   'pdo' => array(\n *     PDO::ATTR_TIMEOUT => 5,\n *   ),\n * );\n * @endcode\n *\n * WARNING: The above defaults are designed for database portability.
