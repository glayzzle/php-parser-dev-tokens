The base path (the subdirectory where the front controller\n   *     is found) will be added to the path. Additional query arguments for\n   *     local paths must be supplied in $options['query'], not part of $uri.\n   *   - If your external URL contains a query (e.g. http:\/\/example.com\/foo?a=b),\n   *     then you can either URL encode the query keys and values yourself and\n   *     include them in $uri, or use $options['query'] to let this method\n   *     URL encode them.\n   * @param array $options\n   *   (optional) An associative array of additional options, with the following\n   *   elements:\n   *   - 'query': An array of query key\/value-pairs (without any URL-encoding) to\n   *     append to the URL.\n   *   - 'fragment': A fragment identifier (named anchor) to append to the URL.\n   *     Do not include the leading '#' character.\n   *   - 'absolute': Defaults to FALSE. Whether to force the output to be an\n   *     absolute link (beginning with http:). Useful for links that will be\n   *     displayed outside the site, such as in an RSS feed.\n   *   - 'https': Whether this URL should point to a secure location. If not\n   *     defined, the current scheme is used, so the user stays on HTTP or HTTPS\n   *     respectively. TRUE enforces HTTPS and FALSE enforces HTTP.\n   * @param bool $collect_bubbleable_metadata\n   *   (optional) Defaults to FALSE.
